# Bytebot Desktop App

The desktop app packages **bytebot-agent**, **bytebotd** and the web UI into a single Electron application.

## Required Permissions

- **Network access** – communicate with the agent services.
- **File system** – store data in the workspace directory.
- **Screen recording & accessibility** (macOS) – allow desktop control.

Grant these when prompted by your operating system.

## Post-install Prompts

On first launch the app creates a workspace directory and displays a setup message. The OS may ask for the permissions above; approve them so Bytebot can function correctly.

## Workspace Directory

All data is stored in a dedicated workspace located in your app data folder (e.g., `~/Library/Application Support/bytebot` on macOS or `%APPDATA%\\bytebot` on Windows).
